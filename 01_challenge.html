        <h1>Difficult Choices</h1>
        <p>There is a cost, always, to making difficult choices. <br>
            The key is making sure that cost is not regret. <br>

        <h1>Everybody Dies</h1>
        <p>
            Everybody dies sooner or later. <br>
            Donâ€™t worry about your death. <br>
            Worry about your life. <br>
            Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. <br>
