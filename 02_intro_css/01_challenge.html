        <p>The <em>wolf</em> is awesome because <strong>it is highly intelligent and caring</strong>.</p>
        <p>Wolves are complex, highly intelligent animals who are caring, playful, and above all devoted to family. <br>
            Only a select few other species exhibit these traits so clearly. Just like elephants, gorillas and dolphins, <br>
            wolves educate their young, take care of their injured and live in family groups.</p>
