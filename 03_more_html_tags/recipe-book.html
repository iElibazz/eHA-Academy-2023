    <h3>How to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by <strong>sauteeing the Onions</strong>. 
            This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. 
            This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ginger and garlic </strong> and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, 
            you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the blended peppers</strong>. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, 
            and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, 
            you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
        <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</li>
        <li>Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
        <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</li>

        <li><strong>Meat Pie Filling</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the oil to a pan and saute the onions for about 1 minute. Add the ground beef and cook until it's well browned.</li>
                <li>Add the curry powder, thyme, bouillon powder (cube), and salt and mix together. Then stir in the carrots and potatoes. Cook till tender.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour and water until smooth and stir the mixture with the filling (this will thicken the filling).</li>

                <li>Add the Margarine and butter (or margarine alone if you choose to) and rub it with the flour until you get a crumbly texture ‚Äì like Breadcrumbs then begin to add Cold Water, a little at a time until it forms a stiff dough</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead for 1 minute then place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge to rest for about 30 minutes ( skip refrigerating if you want a less flaky pie).</li>
            </ol>        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Let‚Äôs put them together</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Roll out the dough to about 1/4 of an inch thick then cut out your desired size circles and distribute the filling inside each cut-out pie dough (don't overfill so you can be able to easily close the Pie).</li>
                <li>Crack an egg in a small bowl, add 1 tablespoon of water and whisk together then use a pastry brush to brush the edges of the Pie</li>
                <li>Fold the pie over to seal (and crimp the edge if not using a pie cutter) and use a fork to create a couple of vents on the Pie (this will help prevent air pockets in your pie)</li>
                <li>Brush the surface of the Pie with the Egg wash and arrange the pies on a parchment paper-lined tray.</li>
                <li>Bake at 350¬∞F for 20 to 30 minutes or till golden brown.</li>
                <li>There you have it! Your fresh Nigerian meat pie is all done!!. Serve with a cup of hot Tea for morning breakfast or a chill drink for afternoon or evening snack. Enjoy!</li>
