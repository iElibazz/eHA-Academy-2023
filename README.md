This is the start of something beautiful

The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it. Work around it or work through it. No matter what, it changes. It becomes something new. The next version. The inevitable upgrade.

Sometimes things don’t work out the way we hope. You can feel like you’ve come to an end, and you don’t know what to do next. But if you just keep going, you find something new to fight for.
